'''1. Start with two 2D arrays, one containing liquid (li = 1, vi = 0) or 
vapour (vi = 1, li = 0), the other containing nanoparticle sites (ni = 0, 1). 
Nanoparticle sites exclude liquid or gas, just nanoparticle.

2. Choose a selection of N random sites in the liquid array to attempt to change state. 

3. Calculate change in energy Î”E of state change, taking into account NNN interactions.

4. Calculate probability of energy change, and compare to x in U(0,1). If prob > x, 
accept. If prob < x, deny. 

5. Attempt to move a nanoparticle by one step in a randomized direction (random walk). 

6. Accept move IFF the lattice spots the nanoparticle is moving to are completely 
filled with liquid, and accept only with metropolis probability above.

7. If move is accepted, fill displaced spots with fluid.

8. Repeat steps 5-7 P number of times per each liquid cycle, and do so for a number 
of random nanoparticles M each cycle (i.e. 30 nanoparticle cycles per solvent cycle).

9. Repeat until we have completed a set number of cycles. '''
